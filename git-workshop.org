* Pre-installation
** Mac users
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Visit [[https://brew.sh/]]. Copy and paste the command there into your terminal.
** If you don't already have a favourite text editor
   - Visit [[https://atom.io/]] to download and install Atom.

* What is Git?
  - A version-control system set up to record /annotated/ changes to your files.
  - Especially suitable for text files such as LaTeX and other code.
  - Currently one of the most popular and supported such systems.

* Why use Git when we have Dropbox?

** Git has better revision history
   - Clearly see who changed what when.
   - Active control over saving revisions: avoid accidents!
   - Excellent support for parallel universes.
   - Entire history saved on the local copy.
** Git is optimised for collaboration
   - No more conflicted copies! Edit whenever you like.
   - Smooth and transparent merges.
   - Fast synchronisation.

* Installation and basic setup
** Installation
   - Mac users: run the following in your terminal.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ brew install git
     #+END_SRC
   - Windows users: visit [[https://gitforwindows.org/]] and download.
   - Linux users: install from your package manager.

** First steps
   - Open a terminal window (or Git Bash) and check that git installed correctly.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git --version
     #+END_SRC
   - You can get help at any time with these commands.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git help
     $ man git
     $ man git-[subcommand]
     #+END_SRC
   - The official Git website is a fantastic resource: [[https://git-scm.com]].

** Initial setup
   - Let's see what the current configuration is.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git config --list
     #+END_SRC
   - Set up your identity.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     $ git config --global user.email "Your Email"
     #+END_SRC
   - Optionally set up some extras.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
     $ git config --global color.ui auto
     #+END_SRC

** Basic terminal glossary
   |-----------+------------------------------------|
   | /         | <                                  |
   | ~~~       | Home directory                     |
   | ~cd x~    | Change directory to ~x~            |
   | ~ls~      | List contents of current directory |
   | ~cp x y~  | Copy file ~x~ to file ~y~          |
   | ~mv x y~  | Move/rename file ~x~ to file ~y~   |
   | ~mkdir x~ | Make directory ~x~                 |
   | ~pwd~     | Print working directory            |

* Let's start a project!
** Make the repository
   - Create a directory containing a new Git repository.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ cd ~
     $ git init testproject
     #+END_SRC
   - Or, turn an existing directory into a Git repository.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ cd [desired-directory]
     $ git init
     #+END_SRC
   - Go into this directory, and have a look around.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ cd testproject
     $ ls -a
     $ ls .git
     #+END_SRC

** Some notation
   - Working directory :: The directory containing your project files.
   - (Local) Git repository :: The ~.git~ directory inside your working directory.
   - Staging area :: What you've told Git to add to the next revision.
   - Commit :: The act of recording the staging area as a new revision.

* Changing and committing
** Make the changes
   - Check the status of your repo. Do this often!
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git status
     #+END_SRC
   - Write a dummy LaTeX file of your choice, save, and compile.
   - Check the status again.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git status
     #+END_SRC

** Ignore unnecessary files
   - Visit [[https://github.com/asilata/.dotfiles]] and save the raw version of the ~gitignore_global~ file. 
   - Move it to the correct location.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ mv ~/Downloads/gitignore_global ~/.gitignore_global
     #+END_SRC
   - Now see what git says.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ cd ~/testproject
     $ git status
     #+END_SRC

** Stage and commit your changes     
   - Add your new file to the staging area. Then commit.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git add [name-of-your-latex-file]
     $ git status
     $ git commit -m "[short descriptive message]"
     #+END_SRC
   - Have a look at what happened.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git status
     $ git log
     #+END_SRC
   - Now stage and commit a few more changes.

* Undoing things
** Unstaging files
   - Stage some more changes. You can "unstage" them before committing. 
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git reset --
     #+END_SRC
   - You can also unstage individual files. Just write the filename after the command.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git add .
     $ git reset -- [filename]
     #+END_SRC

** Throwing away unstaged/uncommitted changes
   - ⚠ To discard unstaged changes in a single file, /check out/ the last staged version.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git checkout -- [filename]
     #+END_SRC
   - ⚠ To throw away any uncommitted changes, do a hard reset.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git reset --hard
     #+END_SRC
   - Safer option: /stash/ away changes, and /pop/ them to get them back.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git stash
     $ git stash pop
     #+END_SRC
   - Now stage and commit some more changes.

** Going back in time
   - You can recover any of the older, committed versions of your files.
   - To do this, you can "check out" a file from an older commit.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git log --oneline
     $ git checkout [commit] [filename]
     #+END_SRC
   - To throw away the changes you (re-)introduced, do a hard reset again.
     
* Working with remotes
  - Remote (repository) :: An external Git repository that your local repository connects to and syncs with.
** Connecting to remotes
   - You can host a remote on service such as [[https://github.com/][GitHub]], [[https://bitbucket.org/][BitBucket]], or [[https://gitlab.com/][GitLab]]. 
   - You can either /clone/ an existing remote repo to make a local repo, or copy over your local repo to a remote hosting service.
   - We'll do both today, working with GitHub. The other services are very similar.

** Connecting to GitHub with ssh
   - Create an account at [[https://github.com/]].
   - Check for existing ssh keys.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ ls -al ~/.ssh
     #+END_SRC
   - If you don't see any, generate a new one first. This command creates one with an empty passphrase.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[your email]" -P ""
     #+END_SRC
   - Detailed instructions are at [[https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/]].

** Connecting to GitHub with ssh (continued)
   - Open your public key file with your favourite text editor.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ atom ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &
     #+END_SRC
   - Navigate to /GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key/ and copy and paste the contents of the key file there.
   - Test your connection.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ ssh -T git@github.com
     #+END_SRC

* Let's host our project on GitHub
** Create your GitHub remote repo
   - Hit ~+~ in the top right corner of your GitHub account, and then /New repository/.
   - Call it whatever you like and hit /Create repository/.
   - Now go to your project and add GitHub as a remote.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ cd ~/testproject
     $ git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/testproject.git
     $ git remote -v
     #+END_SRC

** More about remotes and pushing
   - origin :: The conventional name for your default remote repository.
   - Push :: The act of sending the changes you committed to your local repository to your remote repository.

** Pushing to your default remote
   - Unlike a commit, you don't write a message when you push.
   - The first time, you need to specify that you're pushing your "master" branch to the "origin" remote.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git push -u origin master
     #+END_SRC
   - Afterwards you can just push.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git push
     #+END_SRC

* Collaboration and conflicts
** Some more notation
   - Cloning :: Getting a full copy of a remote repository as your local repository.
   - Push access :: Whether you have permission to push onto a repo you cloned. Usually you don't!
** Find a partner and add them to your repo
   - Player 1 ::
                 - Navigate to your GitHub repository and then to /Settings > Collaborators/.
                 - Add your partner --- gives them push access.
   - Player 2 ::
                 - Navigate to the repository.
                 - Under /Clone or download/, select /Clone with SSH/.
                 - Copy the address given, and clone it.
                   #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
                   $ git clone [address] [repo-name]
                   $ cd [repo-name]
                   #+END_SRC
** Create some divergence
   - Modify *different parts* of the same file, stage, and commit. Then try to push.
   - Git will complain to the second person who tries to push.

** In order to push, pull first
   - The remote rejected your changes because your repo was not in sync.
   - Fetch and merge first. Git will "fast-forward merge".
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git fetch
     $ git merge
     #+END_SRC
   - There is a single command to accomplish the above.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git pull
     #+END_SRC

** Create some conflict
   - Now modify the same part of a single file, stage and commit.
   - Again, try to push, and note that Git complains to the second person.
   - Pull (or fetch and merge) again. This time, Git will complain about a conflict. Don't panic!
** Fixing conflicts
   - See which files need work.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git status
     #+END_SRC
   - Open the file(s) listed in your text editor. You will see some conflict markers, such as below.
     #+BEGIN_SRC style:zenburn
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Hello, world!
     =======
     Hello, universe!
     >>>>>>> origin/master
     #+END_SRC
   - Keep the version you like, or mix and match. Delete the conflict markers. Do this at every conflicted section, then save.
** Fixing conflicts (continued)
   - Now add all the files again.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git add .
     #+END_SRC
   - Then commit as usual, and push if you like.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session 
     $ git commit -m "Fixed conflict in the greeting."
     $ git push
     #+END_SRC

* Branching
** Branches are parallel universes of your project.
   - Any work you do in Git happens in some branch. The default one you start off with is called "master".
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git branch
     #+END_SRC
   - If you want to work on your own for a bit without messing up the default branch, you can make a new branch.
   - Branching is very fast in Git, so use it extensively!
** Creating and working with branches
   - The plain ~git branch~ command lists all the branches, but you can also use it to create a new branch.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git branch testing
     $ git branch
     $ git checkout testing
     $ git branch
     #+END_SRC
   - Go ahead and commit some changes in the new branch. It doesn't affect the master branch.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git log --oneline
     $ git checkout master 
     $ git log --oneline
     #+END_SRC
** Merging changes
   - If you're happy with your tests and want to put them in the master branch, you can /merge/ them back in.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell session
     $ git checkout master
     $ git merge testing
     $ git log --oneline
     #+END_SRC

* Forking (GitHub-specific)
  - Usually you can't push to other people's repositories in GitHub.
  - If you 'Fork' someone's repo, it gets copied (cloned) over to your GitHub page.
  - Now you can add it as a remote and push to it.

* Git clients
  - There are lots of Git clients out there. Try out a few, and select the one that works best for you.
  - Here are just a few of the available options.
    - The [[https://atom.io/packages/git-control][git-control]] package ---  manage git within atom.
    - [[https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/][Sourcetree]], [[https://desktop.github.com][GitHub desktop]] --- GUI clients for Mac and Windows.
    - [[https://www.gitkraken.com/][Git Kraken]] --- GUI client; works on Linux as well.
    - [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] --- a Git interface within Emacs. My personal favourite!
